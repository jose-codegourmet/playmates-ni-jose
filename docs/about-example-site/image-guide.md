# PawPair Image Placement Guide

## Purpose

This guide explains where every PawPair image should be placed, how it should be cropped, and which visual elements should remain editable in React.

The website should combine:

- Natural pet and lifestyle photography
- Clean product mockups
- Minimal branded illustrations
- Real HTML text and interactive UI
- Responsive crops for mobile, tablet, and desktop

> Do not place important headlines, buttons, pricing, compatibility scores, chat text, or navigation inside generated images. Build those elements in React so they remain responsive, accessible, and editable.

# Global Image Rules

## Use `next/image`

Use `next/image` for photography and raster illustrations.

Every meaningful image should include:

- Descriptive alt text
- Correct dimensions or `fill`
- A responsive `sizes` value
- An intentional aspect ratio
- An intentional `object-position`

## General Styling

Photography:

```text
rounded-[24px] to rounded-[32px]
overflow-hidden
object-cover
```

Product mockups:

```text
object-contain
subtle CSS shadow
```

Transparent illustrations:

```text
object-contain
transparent background
```

## Keep These Elements in React

Do not bake these into images:

- Pet profile cards
- Compatibility meters
- Match notifications
- Chat messages
- Safety checklists
- Meetup cards
- Map previews
- Buttons
- Pricing information
- Testimonials
- Blog titles

The pricing page does not require a large dedicated photo.

Use smaller brand elements instead:

Recommended sections:

```text

apps/web/src/sections/pricing/comparison/
apps/web/src/sections/pricing/faq/
apps/web/src/sections/pricing/final-cta/
```

For the final CTA, reuse a different crop of:

```text
final-cta-happy-match.webp
```

---

# Contact Page

The contact page should remain form-focused.

Recommended image usage:

- PawPair icon beside the page heading
- Small pet avatar stack
- Optional crop from `about-pawpair-community.webp`

Avoid placing a large image beside a long contact form on mobile.

Recommended sections:

```text
apps/web/src/sections/contact/hero/
apps/web/src/sections/contact/contact-form/
apps/web/src/sections/contact/contact-options/
apps/web/src/sections/contact/faq-preview/
apps/web/src/sections/contact/final-cta/
```

    fill
    priority
    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 42vw"

    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 60vw"

# Loading Priority

Use `priority` only for images visible above the fold.

## Priority Images

- Header logo
- Hero lifestyle image
- Mochi portrait when immediately visible

## Lazy-Loaded Images

- Safety section
- About page image
- Community walk
- Testimonials
- Blog images
- Footer assets
- 404 illustration

---

# Optimization Guidance

## Photography

Use:

```text
WebP
```

Recommended quality:

```text
78–85
```

## Transparent Assets

Use:

```text
PNG
```

or WebP with alpha when it fits the workflow.

## Suggested Maximum Dimensions

| Asset | Suggested Maximum |
| --- | --- |
| Hero image | `1800 × 2250` |
| Wide section image | `2200 × 1240` |
| Blog image | `1600 × 1000` |
| Pet portrait | `1000 × 1250` |
| 404 illustration | `1600 × 1200` |
| Phone mockup | `1800 × 1350` |

The generated logo should eventually be redrawn or traced into SVG before production use.

---

# Missing Image Fallbacks

Every image-driven component should have a fallback state.

Suggested fallback:

- Warm cream background
- PawPair icon centered
- Subtle paw decoration
- Fixed expected aspect ratio
- No broken-image symbol

Use:

```text
/public/images/brand/logo-pawpair-icon.png
```

as the central fallback mark.

---

# Storybook Guidance

Image paths should be reusable in stories.

Example:

```ts
export const DEFAULT_HERO_IMAGE =
  "/images/hero/hero-pet-meetup.webp";
```

Create stories for:

- Default image
- Missing-image fallback
- Mobile crop
- Dark-mode container
- Image-left layout
- Image-right layout
- Long-copy layout
- Reduced-motion overlays

---
